                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                    <p>This project deals about Data Science is the study that concerns the retrieval and analysis of data sets, intending to identify information and correspondences hidden in the unprocessed data, defined as raw. Data Science, in other words, is the science that combines programming skills and mathematical and statistical knowledge to extract meaningful information from data.

                        Data Science consists of the application of machine learning algorithms to numerical, textual data, images, video, and audio content. The algorithms, therefore, perform specific tasks that concern the extraction, cleaning, and processing of data, generating in turn, data that are transformed into real value for each organization.</p>

                    <h3>Artficial Inteligence</h3>
                    <p>This project deals about Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that usually necessitate human intelligence. These tasks include visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, language translation, and more. AI systems use algorithms and statistical models to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming for each specific task.</p>

                    <h3>Cyber Security</h3>
                    <p>This project deals about Organizations all across the globe thrive on data. They gather and analyze the data of millions of users to develop products that meet the customers' needs. And so, even a single breach can lead to a data breach of millions of people. Most of this data is sensitive and can cause much damage to users. For example, the Yahoo data breach in August 2013 impacted the accounts of almost 3 billion people. As such, the importance of cybersecurity is unparalleled. Data breaches lead to a loss of trust and faith from customers and a substantial financial impact on the organization. One may argue that technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated and can prevent these attacks. However, they forget that cybercriminals are also becoming more sophisticated and using subtler ways to attack. Therefore, cybersecurity is imperative. It is at the center of all organizations, whether small or big. The cybersecurity market is expected to grow to $266 billion by 2027 from $189.9 billion in 2023, making cybersecurity more necessary </p>
